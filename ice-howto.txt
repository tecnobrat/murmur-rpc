1. Download and unpack ICE
wget http://www.zeroc.com/download/Ice/3.3/Ice-3.3.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf Ice-3.3.1.tar.gz

2. Compile the ICE CPP bindings (these are required for all other bindings)
You will need mcpp-devel from the Zeroc website installed to compile.

cd Ice-3.3.1/cpp
make
(wait 20 minutes)
sudo make install

3. Compile and install the Ice RUBY bindings
cd ../rb
make
sudo make install
export RUBYLIB=/opt/Ice-3.3.1/ruby:$RUBYLIB
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Ice-3.3.1/lib:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you don't want to always have to keep running those export lines, also add them to your ~/.bashrc:

export RUBYLIB=/opt/Ice-3.3.1/ruby:$RUBYLIB
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Ice-3.3.1/lib:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. At this point, Ice should be available to Ruby:

$ irb
irb(main):001:0> require 'Ice'
=> true

5. Generate the ruby Slice file, if you want to use a version different than provided.

wget -O Murmur.ice "http://mumble.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=mumble/mumble;a=blob_plain;f=src/murmur/Murmur.ice;hb=HEAD"
../cpp/bin/slice2rb Murmur.ice

cp Murmur.rb #{MANAGER_ROOT}/vendor/ice
